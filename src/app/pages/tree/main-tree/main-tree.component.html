            <p class="ct_fs_16 mb-1">Emissions from the burning of fuels in
                stationary sources owned or controlled by an organization. These
                sources include equipment and systems that are fixed in place, such
                as boilers, furnaces, turbines, and other types of heating and
                power-generating equipment.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Liquid fuels: Emissions resulting from the combustion of liquid
                    fuels in stationary sources are a significant part of an
                    organization’s overall carbon footprint due to the widespread
                    use of liquid fuels such as gasoline, diesel, fuel oil,
                    kerosene, and others.
                </li>
                <li>Solid fuels: These fuels typically include coal, peat, and other
                    solid materials used for heating, power generation, or
                    industrial processes.
                </li>
                <li>Gaseous fuels: These fuels are typically in a gaseous state at
                    normal atmospheric conditions and include natural gas, propane,
                    butane, and other similar gases used for heating, power
                    generation, and transportation.
                </li>
                <li>Biofuels: Biofuels are derived from renewable biomass sources
                    such as plant matter, agricultural residues, or waste materials.
                </li>
                <li>Biomass: Biomass refers to organic materials derived from plants
                    or animals that can be used as fuel. This includes wood,
                    agricultural residues, animal waste, and dedicated energy crops.
                </li>
                <li>Biogas: Biogas is a renewable energy source produced through the
                    anaerobic digestion or fermentation of organic materials such as
                    agricultural residues, food waste, sewage sludge, or energy
                    crops.

            <h5 class="ct_fs_16 mb-0">To collect stationary combustion data for
                emissions in a company, follow these steps:
            </h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify stationary combustion sources - Determine which
                    equipment and facilities generate emissions, such as: Boilers,
                    Furnaces, Generators, Heaters, Chillers
                </li>
                <li>Collect fuel consumption data:
                    Fuel Purchase Records - Collect data from fuel purchase receipts
                    and invoices.
                    Usage Logs - Maintain logs of fuel usage in vehicles, machinery,
                    and equipment.
                    Meter Readings - Use meter readings for equipment that consumes
                    liquid fuels.
                    Operational Records - Document hours of operation for
                    fuel-consuming equipment
                </li>
                <li>Relevant departments for collecting the data - Production
                    department, Operational department

                emissions
            </h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Select the months and year for which you want to enter the
                    emissions data. If you select multiple months, same data will be
                    replicated for the months selected.
                </li>
                <li>Once submitted, data is sent for approval. Manager of facility
                    or the admin has approval rights. Only the approved data is
                    included in emissions calculations. You can check the approval
                    status in ‘Status’ tab
                </li>
                <li>User can attach the bills, invoices as attachment for record
                    purpose.
